    <h3>Depression Explaination</h3>
    <p>Depression is a common mental healh disorder worldwide, where more than 280 million people are suffering from (World Health Organization, 2021). An estimate of 5&percnt; of adults and 5.7&percnt; of the elderly suffer from depression. It can affect people severely to the point that they function poorly when performing their daily activities. Depression at its worse can lead people to have suicidal thoughts and commit suicide. Over 700000 people are victims of suicide each year.
    </p>

    <p>Thankfully, there are ways to effectively treat and overcome depression. However, not everyone will be able to afford treatments as there are many factors such as the lack of resources, lack of health-care professionals and stigma surrounding mental disorders that makes it hard to be accessible. Therefore, it is important for all of us to be educated on depression to help those who are in need or even ourselves.</p>
